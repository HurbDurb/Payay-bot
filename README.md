# Payay-bot
PB is an open source IRC bot build with accessibility in mind.

It has just started development but is being worked on all the time.
The bot will utilize plugins to it's most and is fully customizable because of that.

The bot is written in Python and so will it's plugins be.

Right now we have a basic plugin framework working and are getting the IRC part in.
We will be writing a documentation so you can start off personalizing your experience with plugins right away!
Examples will also be included!
