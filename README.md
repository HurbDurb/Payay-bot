# Payay-bot
PB is an open source IRC bot build with accessibility in mind.

It has just started development but is being worked on all the time.
The bot will utilize plugins to it's most and is fully customizable because of that.

The bot is written in Python and so will it's plugins be.

More information and of course actual builds of the bot will be available later so stay tuned!
